  <summary><strong>More Info</strong></summary>
  <br/>
  <p>
    In my professional work, I primarily contribute to large, enterprise frontend
    applications with complex business logic and long-term maintenance requirements.
    This involves close collaboration with backend, product, and design teams.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of work hours, I build focused side projects to deepen my understanding of
    frontend architecture, tooling, and cloud integration. I also try to take care of my health by eating healthy,
    going to the gym, and spending time with loved ones so I can stay sharp and do my best work for the long haul.
